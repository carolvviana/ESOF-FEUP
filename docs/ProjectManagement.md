## Iteration 0 Retrospective
### What went well?
Team members were familiar with Figma and did the mockups without any problems. SÃ©rgio was responsile for the initial prototype (hard coded version of some pages) and also did a great job. Every member worked for the success of the team (doing different tasks).

### What didn't go so well?
The team didn't do a great job on the domain model. The product vision could still be improved

### What have we learned?
We learned to setup and take the first steps in Flutter. We also learned how to properly prototype with Figma and work together as a team.

### What still puzzles us?
Some user stories and acceptance tests still aren't precise enough
